## My process

I used the design and mocked the sections out on paper so it was easy to break it down into code elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to center an item vertically and horizontally using absolute positioning.
I used mobile first design approach and used media queries to make the display larger on bigger screen sizes.

### Continued development

I want to continue exploring more complex design challenges.
